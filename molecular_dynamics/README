In this directory contains all scripts for running Molecular Dynamics. 
It must requires Gromacs instalation: http://www.gromacs.org/

Molecular Dynamics are used in several kind of scenarios. 
Each scenario is assigned a specific folder and they are described below:

* refinament
      Molecular Dynamics are employed to refine a number of protein structures. 

* initial_individual
	Molecular Dynamics are employed to generate initial population.

* minimization
	Steep algorithm to minimize all pdb files in directory.
